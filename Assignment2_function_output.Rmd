```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Sourcing the function, "square_column" from the script "Assignment2_function.R"
```{r, echo=TRUE}
source("Assignment2_function.R")
```

Printing the airquality dataset to show the true original values
```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(airquality)
```

In the first code, I'm using the airquality dataset and squaring the 3rd column using the square_column function. We can see the result below. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
squared <- square_column(airquality, 3)
head(squared)
```

In the second code, I'm still using the airquality dataset and now squaring the 2nd column using the square_column function. We can see the result below. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
squared <- square_column(airquality, 2)
head(squared)
```
